# Simple Simulated-Annealing Cell Placement Tool / DD2Project
The program takes an input file with the first line consisting of 4 integers ( number of cells, number of connections or nets, number of rows on the grid, number of columns on the grid).Then each line in the .txt file represents a net or a connection with the first integer in the line represents the number of cells in the net followed by the cells connected in the net.

The program prints the input file first then the original placement then the placemenet after running the algorithm and the corresponding wire length.

To change input file just change the string in line 162 to the new file name needed to be tested
